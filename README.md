*To-Do Daily List* is a front-end short application designed to help users organize their daily tasks. Users will be able to interact with the website by typing their plans and after manipulating the list by checking or deleting the task. 

The main goal was to create an interactive front-end project using JavaScript for educational purposes. HTML provides the structure of the page and CSS the styling.

## Features
***

 * The main feature of the website is the to-do list application, designed to be very responsive on every device:

   * The title of the application 'My Day' encourages the user to add a list for the current day. The current date is generated next to the title using  Date () constructor in JavaScript.

   * The text input box has an autofocus attribute to direct the user straight into the input field, and a hover efect styled with CSS.

   * On the right side of our text box is a plus icon button which will generate a list with the tasks typed by the user. The functionality of the plus button to create the list was accomplished in JavaScript by:

     *  Having a function and two events: onclick and keydown. By doing this we give to our user the option to add his task, either by click either by pressing the enter key. 
     
     * The code in the function will generate:  

       * An alert if the user doesn't type anything in the box.

       * Or will generate the user's task in a styled list below and remove it from the text box.

     * Each task added has as well two buttons offering the option for the task to be either checked, crossing a line over it or to be deleted.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs
***

* When validating my HTML I received an error for using an alt atribute for the font icons.
  * Removing the atribute fixed the issue.

* For JavaScript my buttons for checking and deleting the added tasks weren't working.

  * I thought it has to be related to the fact that my buttons were created in JavaScript using template literate and they don't exist in the actual HTML file.

  * Reading about the dinamically JavaScript helped to realize I was placing my function for those buttons wrong.

### Unsolved Bugs
***

* No unsolved bugs
